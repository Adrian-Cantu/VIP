Sorry, we have to rerun the configuration dialog for CPAN.pm due to
some missing parameters. Configuration will be written to
 <</home/yangli/edirect/_cpan/CPAN/MyConfig.pm>>

 <install_help>

Warning: You do not have write permission for Perl library directories.

To install modules, you need to configure a local Perl library directory or
escalate your privileges.  CPAN can help you by bootstrapping the local::lib
module or by configuring itself to use 'sudo' (if available).  You may also
resolve this problem manually if you need to customize your setup.

What approach do you want?  (Choose 'local::lib', 'sudo' or 'manual')
 [manual] manual

Your 'urllist' is already configured. Type 'o conf init urllist' to change it.

Autoconfiguration complete.

You can re-run configuration any time with 'o conf init' in the CPAN shell
